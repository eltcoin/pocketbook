## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- (Optional) Deployed AddressClaim contract

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eltcoin/pocketbook.git
cd pocketbook
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Usage

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

Click "Connect Wallet" in the header to connect your MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet.

### 2. Claim Your Address

1. Navigate to "Claim Address"
2. Fill in your metadata:
   - Display name (required)
   - Avatar (emoji or URL)
   - Biography
   - Website
   - Social media handles
3. Choose privacy settings
4. Sign the transaction to claim your address

### 3. View Claimed Addresses

Use the Explorer to browse recently claimed addresses or search for specific addresses.

### 4. Privacy Management

For private metadata:
- Toggle "Make metadata private" when claiming
- Use "Manage Privacy" to add/remove whitelisted viewers
- Only you and whitelisted addresses can view private metadata

## Smart Contract Development

### Deploying the Contract

The AddressClaim contract needs to be deployed to an Ethereum network:

```solidity
// Example deployment with Hardhat
const AddressClaim = await ethers.getContractFactory("AddressClaim");
const addressClaim = await AddressClaim.deploy();
await addressClaim.deployed();
console.log("AddressClaim deployed to:", addressClaim.address);
```

Update the contract address in `src/stores/ethers.js`:

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0xYourDeployedContractAddress";
```

### Contract Methods

#### Claim an Address
```solidity
function claimAddress(
    address _address,
    bytes memory _signature,
    string memory _name,
    // ... other metadata fields
    bool _isPrivate
) public
```

#### Update Metadata
```solidity
function updateMetadata(
    string memory _name,
    // ... other metadata fields
    bool _isPrivate
) public
```

#### Privacy Management
```solidity
function addViewer(address _viewer) public
function removeViewer(address _viewer) public
```

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Verification

All claims are verified through:
1. **Message Signing**: Users sign a message with their private key
2. **Signature Verification**: The contract verifies the signature matches the claimed address
3. **On-Chain Storage**: All data is stored immutably on the blockchain

### Privacy Protection

- **Encrypted Metadata**: Optional encryption using public/private key pairs
- **Whitelist Access**: Control who can view your private information
- **No Central Authority**: Fully decentralized verification

### Best Practices

- Never share your private keys
- Verify contract addresses before interacting
- Review all transactions before signing
- Keep your metadata up-to-date
- Regularly review your privacy whitelist

## Web of Trust

The platform enables building a decentralized web of trust:

1. **Verifiable Identity**: Cryptographically proven ownership
2. **Reputation Building**: Track claims and interactions
3. **Network Effects**: Connect with other verified addresses
4. **Trustless Verification**: No intermediaries required

## Multi-Chain Support

Pocketbook supports simultaneous connections to multiple blockchain networks, allowing users to interact with claims across different chains seamlessly.

### Supported Networks

#### Mainnets
- **Ethereum** - The original smart contract platform
- **Polygon** - Low-cost, high-speed layer 2 solution
- **BNB Smart Chain (BSC)** - Binance's EVM-compatible blockchain
- **Arbitrum One** - Optimistic rollup scaling solution
- **Optimism** - Another optimistic rollup for Ethereum
- **Avalanche** - High-throughput blockchain platform

#### Testnets
- **Sepolia** - Ethereum testnet
- **Polygon Mumbai** - Polygon testnet

### Features

1. **Simultaneous Multi-Chain Connectivity**
   - Connect to all configured networks at once
   - View claims across all chains simultaneously
   - No need to manually switch networks to see data

2. **Cross-Chain Claim Viewing**
   - See if an address has been claimed on multiple networks
   - Compare claim data across chains
   - Unified view of multi-chain identity

3. **Network Switching**
   - Easy switching between networks via MetaMask
   - Automatic network addition if not configured
   - Primary network indicator in the UI

4. **Per-Network Contract Deployment**
   - Each network can have its own contract address
   - Configured via environment variables
   - Graceful handling of networks without deployed contracts

### Configuration

Configure contract addresses for each network in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Ethereum Mainnet
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ETHEREUM=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Polygon
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_POLYGON=0xYourContractAddressHere

# BSC
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_BSC=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Arbitrum
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Optimism
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_OPTIMISM=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Avalanche
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_AVALANCHE=0xYourContractAddressHere

# Testnets
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_SEPOLIA=0xYourContractAddressHere
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_MUMBAI=0xYourContractAddressHere
```

### Architecture

The multi-chain system uses two key stores:

1. **multiChainStore** - Main store for managing multiple blockchain connections
   - Maintains separate providers for each network
   - Handles primary wallet connection via MetaMask
   - Provides methods to query across all chains

2. **Derived Stores**
   - `availableChains` - Lists all accessible networks
   - `primaryNetwork` - Information about the currently active network

### Usage Examples

#### Query Claims Across All Chains

```javascript
import { multiChainStore } from './stores/multichain';

// Get claims for an address across all configured chains
const claims = await multiChainStore.getClaimsAcrossChains('0xYourAddress');

// claims = [
//   { chainId: 1, network: 'Ethereum', claim: {...} },
//   { chainId: 137, network: 'Polygon', claim: {...} }
// ]
```

#### Check Specific Chain

```javascript
// Check if an address is claimed on a specific chain
const result = await multiChainStore.checkClaimOnChain(137, '0xYourAddress');

if (result.success && result.isClaimed) {
  console.log('Address is claimed on Polygon');
}
```

#### Get Chain-Specific Contract

```javascript
// Get contract instance for a specific chain
const polygonContract = multiChainStore.getChainContract(137);

// Use the contract for read operations
const claim = await polygonContract.getClaim('0xYourAddress');
```

## DID (Decentralized Identifier) Support

Pocketbook now supports W3C-compliant Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) following the **did:ethr** method specification.

### What are DIDs?

DIDs are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, self-sovereign digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides to identify.

### DID Format

Each claimed address in Pocketbook automatically receives a DID:

```
did:ethr:0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb1
```

Format: `did:ethr:<ethereum-address>`

### DID Document

Every claimed address has an associated DID Document containing:

- **DID identifier** - The unique DID string
- **Controller** - The address that controls this DID
- **Public Keys** - Verification keys for authentication
- **Service Endpoints** - Endpoints for services (messaging, profile, etc.)
- **Alternative Identifiers** - Other identifiers (ENS names, other DIDs)
- **Timestamps** - Creation and last update times

### DID Functions

#### Resolve a DID to Address

```javascript
const address = await contract.resolveDID("did:ethr:0x...");
```

#### Get DID Document

```javascript
const [did, controller, created, updated] = await contract.getDIDDocument(address);
```

#### Get Public Keys

```javascript
const publicKeys = await contract.getDIDPublicKeys(address);
```

#### Add Service Endpoint

```javascript
// Add a messaging service
await contract.addServiceEndpoint(
  "messaging",           // Service ID
  "MessagingService",    // Service type
  "https://msg.example.com/inbox"  // Endpoint URL
);
```

#### Get Service Endpoints

```javascript
const [ids, types, endpoints] = await contract.getServiceEndpoints(address);
```

#### Add Alternative Identifier

```javascript
// Link an ENS name
await contract.addAlsoKnownAs("alice.eth");

// Link another DID
await contract.addAlsoKnownAs("did:key:z6Mk...");
```

### Benefits of DID Support

1. **Self-Sovereign Identity** - You control your identity without intermediaries
2. **Interoperability** - Works across different blockchain platforms and applications
3. **Verifiable Credentials** - Enables issuing and verifying credentials
4. **Privacy-Preserving** - Selective disclosure of information
5. **Standards-Based** - Compliant with W3C DID specification

### Use Cases

- **Cross-Platform Identity** - Use the same DID across multiple dApps
- **Verifiable Claims** - Issue and verify credentials about the DID
- **Service Discovery** - Link to messaging, profile, or other services
- **Identity Aggregation** - Connect multiple identifiers (ENS, other DIDs)
- **Authentication** - Prove control of the DID cryptographically

### DID Resolution

DIDs can be resolved to retrieve the associated address and DID Document:

```javascript
// Resolve DID to address
const address = await contract.resolveDID("did:ethr:0x...");

// Get full DID Document
const doc = await contract.getDIDDocument(address);
```

### Integration with Other Systems

The did:ethr method is widely supported in the decentralized identity ecosystem, including:

- **uPort** - Mobile self-sovereign identity
- **Veramo** - DID and verifiable credentials framework
- **Ceramic Network** - Decentralized data network
- **3Box** - Distributed user data network
