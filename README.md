    ✨ Censorship immune, Decentralised Human Network & Identity Platform ✨
  </p>
</div>

## Overview

Pocketbook is a revolutionary decentralized identity platform that enables users to claim and verify ownership of their Ethereum addresses. Built with Svelte and Solidity, it creates a censorship-resistant human network where you have complete sovereignty over your digital identity.

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and connect your MetaMask wallet to get started!

### ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Address Claiming** - Prove ownership and attach verified metadata to any address
- 🔐 **Cryptographic Security** - All claims signed and verified on-chain
- 🆔 **DID Support** - W3C compliant Decentralized Identifiers (did:ethr) for self-sovereign identity
- 🏷️ **ENS Integration** - Use human-readable names (name.eth) instead of addresses with full ENS resolution and reverse lookup
- 🌐 **Multi-Chain Support** - Simultaneous connectivity to Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche
- 🔗 **Cross-Chain Identity** - View and manage claims across multiple blockchain networks
- 📦 **IPFS Storage** - Decentralized metadata storage with DID-based content routing
- 🔒 **Privacy Controls** - Choose what's public and whitelist private viewers
- 🌓 **Dark Mode** - Beautiful UI with light and dark themes
- 💼 **Contract Support** - Claim smart contract and token addresses
- 🔌 **Interoperability** - DID-based identity works across decentralized platforms
- 👥 **Social Graph** - Follow/unfollow users, send friend requests, and build your decentralized network
- 🔑 **PGP Signatures** - Add PGP signatures for additional cryptographic verification
